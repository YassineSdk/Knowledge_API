        Split a single document's text into overlapping word-level chunks.

    Combines 'content' and 'raw_content' fields as the text source.
    'content' is used first; 'raw_content' is appended if present.

    Args:
        document:   Dict with at least one of 'content' or 'raw_content' keys.
        chunk_size: Number of words per chunk.
        overlap:    Number of words to repeat at the start of the next chunk.

    Returns:
        List of chunk strings.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If document is empty or not a dict.
        ValueError: If overlap >= chunk_size (would cause an infinite loop).
